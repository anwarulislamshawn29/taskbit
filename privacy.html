  <h1>Privacy Policy for TaskBit Pro</h1>
  <p>Last Updated: June 02, 2025</p>
  <p>TaskBit Pro ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our AI-powered task prioritization Chrome extension. By using TaskBit Pro, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>TaskBit Pro collects the following information solely to provide the extension's functionality:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Task Data:</strong> Information you input, such as task descriptions, categories, deadlines, time estimates, and priority settings. This data is stored locally on your device via Chrome's storage API.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We do not collect usage data for analytics or any purpose beyond the extension's functionality. All processing occurs locally on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Basic device data (e.g., browser type) is used locally to ensure compatibility, but no personally identifiable information (PII) is collected or stored.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not collect sensitive personal data such as your name, email address, or location unless you voluntarily provide it through support requests.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use the collected information exclusively for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and maintain the task prioritization features of TaskBit Pro.</li>
    <li>Respond to your support requests if you contact us.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not share your data with third parties, use it for advertising, or process it for analytics. All processing occurs locally on your device. Your data is never used for any purpose other than the functionality of TaskBit Pro.</p>

  <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>Your data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. We do not transmit or store your data on remote servers. Since data is not transmitted, the risk of unauthorized access is minimized. However, you are responsible for securing your device to prevent unauthorized access to the extension's data.</p>
  <p>We are committed to ensuring that your data privacy and security are 100% assured. We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information locally, but no method is entirely immune to risks if your device is compromised.</p>

  <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
  <p>We do not share your information with third parties under any circumstances, except:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>With your explicit consent for support or troubleshooting.</li>
    <li>If required by law or to protect our rights and safety.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Your data remains on your device and is never used for purposes beyond the extension's functionality.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices and Rights</h2>
  <p>You have full control over your data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Delete tasks or clear all data directly within the extension.</li>
    <li>Disable the extension via Chrome's settings, which stops data processing.</li>
    <li>Contact us at [support@taskbitpro.com] for assistance or clarification.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Since data is stored locally, you control its retention by managing your browser data or uninstalling the extension.</p>

  <h2>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
  <p>TaskBit Pro is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If we learn that we have, we will delete it promptly.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices. We will notify you of significant changes via the extension or our website. The updated policy will take effect upon posting.</p>
